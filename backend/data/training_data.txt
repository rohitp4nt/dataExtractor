The present study has reported the inﬂuence of forest types, altitude and NDVI (normalized differential vegeta-
tion index) on the soil properties. The study area covered four districts viz., Hamirpur, Bilaspur, Sirmaur and Solan
of Himachal Pradesh state of India. To carry out this study, ﬁve forest types at three different altitudes
(600–900 m); (900–1200 m) and (1200–1500 m) above sea level having NDVI values of N1 (0.0–0.1), N2
(0.1–0.2), N3 (0.2–0.3), N4 (0.3–0.4) and N4 (0.4–0.5) were taken into consideration. Among the forest types,
northern mixed dry deciduous forest was largest reservoirs of soil organic carbon (SOC) (4.46, 1.52 and 1.46%
in humus, 0–20 and 21–40 cm soil layers respectively). The lowest values for SOC were found in dry shiwalik
sal forests (2.60, 0.79 and 0.62% in humus, 0–20 and 21–40 cm soil layers respectively). The values of SOC de-
creased with increase in soil depth. The results showed a positive correlation between SOC, available N, P, K,
Ca, S with the altitude and NDVI. However a negative correlation between altitude and NDVI was observed
with the bulk density, available Mg and soil pH. Soil pH had a negative inﬂuence on SOC whereas SOC had a pos-
itive inﬂuence on the availability of Nitrogen (N), Sulphur (S) and Potassium (K). The availability of competing
cations like Potassium (K) and Calcium (Ca) had a negative effect on the availability of less competitive cations
like Magnesium (Mg). The results of the present study can be pivotal in future climate change studies, soil carbon
stock assessment and land use planning along the lines of REDD+ initiatives in North Western Himalayan
ecosystem.

1. Introduction
The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development identiﬁed the need to restore degraded
soils and improvement of soil health. Maintaining soil organic carbon
storage at equilibrium or increasing content towards the optimal level
for the local environment can be achieved by unlocking the full ecosys-
tem services potential of soils fertility and productivity [1]. The carbon
content, nutrient status and physico-chemical properties of forest soils
depend on various factors like altitude, climate and vegetation [2].
Plant tissues are the main source of soil organic matter (SOM), and var-
ious soil properties and nutrient availability are inﬂuenced by it [3].
Physico-chemical characteristics of forest soils vary in space and time
due to variations in topography, climate, physical weathering processes,
vegetation cover, microbial activities, and several other biotic and abi-
otic variables [4]. Tropical moist deciduous forests are the dominant for-
est types of India and contribute 38.7% to the forest SOC pool [5]. The
altitudinal gradient inﬂuences the microclimate particularly air
temperature and annual precipitation and thus determines the physical,
chemical and biological processes in the soil [6, 7].
Remote sensing tools like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
(NDVI) is highly an effective measure for vegetation cover [8–11].
Higher NDVI values imply more vegetation coverage whereas lower
NDVI values indicate lower vegetation coverage [12]. The quantity of
different essential plant nutrients and their form in forest and planta-
tion soil along with their interaction and physical properties has been
reported by many workers [13–15]. But such studies have mostly
been carried out in boreal and sub-arctic [16], tropical [17] and temper-
ate forests [7]. In Indian Himalayan region number of studies [4, 18]
have been reported on soil properties. But there have been relatively
fewer studies to study the effect of altitude on the soil properties and
even fewer on the study of the effect of vegetation (Forest types and
NDVI) on the soil properties in the subtropical north western ecosys-
tems. Keeping in view the importance of these forests in global climatic
mitigation strategy the present study undertaken in the north western
Himalaya of Himachal Pradesh, India to test the hypothesis:
(a) Whether the soil properties change with the change in forest type.
(b) Whether the soil properties change with the change in altitude
(c) Whether the soil properties change with the in NDVI.

Main shrubs present in the study area are Adhatoda vasica, Berberis ly-
ceum, Carissa carandus, Flacourtia indica, Lantana camara, Murraya
koengii and Rubus ellipticus etc. In general, May and June are the hottest
months and December and January are the coldest. On an average the
annual rainfall received varies from 1000 to 1400 mm, bulk of which
is received during monsoons i.e. July to September with few pre-
monsoon showers.
2.2. Experimental methodology
For conducting the present study, three altitudinal ranges (600–900;
900–1200; 1200–1500 m a.s.l.); 5 NDVIs (0.0–0.1, 0.1–0.2, 0.2–0.3,
0.3–0.4 and 0.4–0.5) and 5 forest types (Chir pine plantation, Dry
shiwalik sal forest, Northern mixed dry deciduous forest, Lower
shiwalik pine forest and Himalayan chir pine forest) were selected
(Table 1). The sampled stands were chosen by determining their alti-
tude using GPS device. NDVI values of the chosen stands were deter-
mined using the NDVI maps (2009) procured from NRSA, Dehradun,
India. Thus a total of 15 sites including 05 NDVIs pertaining to 03
different altitudes were selected. These stands fell in seven forest
types, out of which ﬁve aforementioned forest types were selected to
study their effect on soil separately. Around ﬁve samples were taken
from the sample plots (0.1 ha) for each forest type, altitudinal range
and NDVI.
2.3. Soil collection and analysis
Around 100 soil samples were collected from the 15 sample plots
through random sampling. Soil sampling was done by digging proﬁles
up to 0–20 and 21–40 cm. Composite samples from all sub area were
obtained for each depth. Samples were air dried in shade, grinded
with wooden pestle, passed through 2 mm sieve and stored in cloth
bags for further laboratory analysis. Different soil properties calculated
were bulk density (g cm−3) by Speciﬁc gravity method [19]; Soil pH
was calculated as 1:2.5 soil:water suspension [20]. Soil EC (d S m−1)
was calculated by 1:2.5 soil:water suspension, with the help of digital
conductivity bridge [20]. Organic carbon (%) was calculated by Walkley
and Black method [21]. Available nitrogen (kg/ha) and Available

phosphorous (kg/ha) was recorded by application of Alkaline potassium
permanganate method of Subbiah and Asija [22] and Olsen et al. [23] re-
spectively. Available potassium (kg/ha) was calculated by Flame pho-
tometer method of Merwin and Peach [24] and Exchangeable Ca and
Mg (kg/ha) by ﬂame photometer method and Mg by Atomic absorption
spectrometer. Available sulphur (kg/ha) was done as per Turbidimetric
method given by Chesnin and Yien [25]. The data obtained were sub-
jected to statistical analysis as per the procedure suggested by Gomez
and Gomez [26].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Inﬂuence of forest types on the soil properties
The highest soil organic carbon (4.46, 1.52, 1.46%) was reported
highest in northern dry mixed deciduous forests for humus, 0–20 cm
and 21–40 cm depth respectively followed by the upper Himalayan for-
est (4.30, 1.53, 1.31%); lower shiwalik pine forest (3.69, 1.31, 1.01%);
chir pine plantation (2.75, 1.13, 0.84%) and the least for dry shiwalik
sal forests (2.60, 0.79, 0.62%) (Table 3). Higher carbon accumulation in
northern dry mixed deciduous forests could be the fact that all these
sites belonged to the NDVI 0.4–0.5. A higher NDVI value (0.4–0.5) indi-
cates dense canopy cover and thus the leaf litter accumulation would be
quite high, leading to increased carbon accumulation. The species com-
position of the forest stands have been reported to lead to modiﬁcations
in soil organic matter accumulation [27] pH [28–30] and the Cation Ex-
change Capacity (CEC) of the soil [31, 32]. Coniferous forests (Pine spp.)
alter the soil CEC (Cation Exchange Capacity) and thereby decreases the
pH and might decrease the soil enzyme activities compared to the broad
leaved forests growing on similar soil [33]. Hence the decreased soil en-
zyme activity in acidic conditions reported in the Himalayan Chir pine,
Lower Shiwalik pine and Northern dry mixed deciduous forests could
lead to reduced decomposition and hence higher organic carbon accu-
mulation. The organic carbon under broad leaved sal forests was
lower than coniferous pine forests were also supported by the ﬁndings
of Zeng et al. [34]. The values for the organic carbon (1.69%) in dry
shiwalik sal for humus and 0–20 cm layer and 0.62% for 21–40 cm in
the present study was comparable with that of Terai sal forest (1.6%
for 0–15 cm and 0.9% for 15–30 cm) and were lower than the carbon
content in the soils of Hill sal forests (2.09% for upper layer and 1.53%
for the lower layers) [35]. The organic carbon in different soil layers de-
creased with increase in soil depth. Higher organic carbon accumulation
in surface soil than sub-surface could be attributed to higher amount of
litter accumulation on surface. These results were also well supported
by the ﬁndings of [18, 36] for chir pine forests of Himachal Pradesh.
Maximum bulk density (1.369 g cm−3) was recorded under chir pine
plantation and minimum for northern mixed dry deciduous forest
(1.057 g cm−3). The variation in bulk density under different treatments
can be owed to their varying rate of leaf litter decomposition and depo-
sition [34].
The highest pH (6.92) was observed for chir pine plantation,
whereas the lowest pH of (6.41) was recorded for Himalayan chir pine
forest. The pH level was slightly acidic to neutral and could be ascribed
to decomposition of organic matter. Different trends of soil enrichment
could be attributed to the differences in species-site interaction, quan-
tum of litter produced, and difference in the rate of decomposition, min-
eralization, cycling [37–39]. Similar results have also been reported by
Soni [36] for temperate zone of Himachal Pradesh, Yadav [40] in
Chakrata forest division, Saralch [41] for eucalyptus plantation, Bhola
[42] in nitrogen ﬁxing trees and Nayak [43] under high density
plantations.
The soil nutrients more or less followed the same trend as that of or-
ganic carbon. As the competitive cations (N, K, Ca) showed an increasing
trend, the least competitive cation i.e., Mg showed a decreasing trend.
These ﬁndings are in line with reported results of Jones [44]. It was
also seen that the signiﬁcantly maximum available phosphorous
(31.88 kg ha−1) in soil was recorded for northern mixed dry deciduous
forest, followed by Himalayan chir forest (29.72 kg ha−1) N dry shiwalik
sal forests (28.80 kg ha−1) N chir pine plantation (22.76 kg ha−1)
N lower shiwalik pine forests (21.38 kg ha−1) in decreasing order. Sev-
eral authors [45–47] reported similar trend of nutrients in the past. The
range for available nitrogen reported in the present study was well sup-
ported by the ﬁndings of Soni [36], Sharma [48], and Malik [49] in parts
of north western Himalaya.
3.2. Effect of Altitude on soil properties
The organic carbon content increased with increasing altitudinal
ranges. Highest values for organic carbon was reported from the
1200–1500 m altitude for all the soil layers (5.09; 1.76; 1.51% in
humus, 0–20 cm and 21–40 cm respectively) followed by the
900–1200 m altitude (4.13, 1.39 and 1.20%) and the lowest from 600
to 900 m altitude (3.28, 1.30, 1.08%) (Table 3). The highest values of or-
ganic carbon in the higher altitude can be owed to continuous accumu-
lation of leaf litter and slower decomposition rate due to lower
temperature. Slower decomposition can lead to lesser mineralization
and hence losses of organic carbon through erosion will be lower at
higher altitudes and hence more organic carbon content. The values of
the present study are well supported by the ﬁndings of Maurya et al.
[50], Banerjee et al. [51], and Bora et al. [52]. Nath and Deori [53] ob-
served an increase in organic matter content from 1.03 to 9.78% in
soils as the altitude increased from 180 to 1800 m. Similar ﬁndings
were reported by Rajput et al. [38], Shah et al. [54] for the temperate
North Western Himalayan region.
Similar trend was reﬂected from the ﬁndings of Zhu et al. [55] across
major forest ecosystems on Mt Changbai, China along an altitudinal gra-
dient of 700–2000 m; Shelukindo et al. [56] for Miombi woodlands of
Tanzania and Dielman et al. [57] reported 5.1 kg C m−2 per 1000 m in-
crease in altitude. Sheikh et al. [58] reported that SOC decreased with in-
crease in altitude and Lieﬁeld et al. [59] found no relation of SOC with
altitude. Thus multiple physiographic variables play role in the amount
of soil organic carbon in a given soil. Soil organic carbon decreased with
increase in soil depth in all the altitudes. Similar result was reported by
several workers [48, 50, 60, 61]. Bulk density showed a decreasing trend
with increasing altitudinal ranges (Table 3). This can be owed to

increasing trend of organic matter with increased temperature and de-
composition rate at increasing altitudes. Bulk density, in general, in-
creased with the increasing soil depth (Table 3). The lower bulk
density in upper layer of soil may have resulted from dilution of soil
(mineral matter) with lesser denser material (organic matter) and im-
provement in soil aggregation. Improvement in aggregation encouraged
ﬂuffy and porous condition of soil which resulted in low density values.
The reduction in bulk density of soil with increase in soil organic carbon
have been amply reported in literature like Soane et al. [60], Coote and
Ramsay [62], and Senneh [63].
Available N, P, K and Ca increased with increasing altitude (Table 4).
Increase in available nitrogen content is due to higher organic carbon
contents of the soils on higher altitudinal ranges [50, 52]. Exchangeable
Magnesium was found to decrease with increase in altitude. It may be
owed to the reason that the concentrations of competing cations like
K+ and Ca++ increased with altitude and thus the competition forced
magnesium to decrease in its exchangeable form as reported by Jones
[44]. The results revealed that soils of higher altitudes were more acidic
in reaction. The pH had highly signiﬁcant negative correlation with alti-
tude. The decrease in pH at higher altitudes can be ascribed to leaching
of bases from the surface because of higher rainfall at higher altitudes
and higher concentration of H+ ions in the soils resulting from decom-
position of organic matter. [52]
3.3. Effect of NDVI on soil properties
The organic carbon increased with increasing NDVIs. The organic
carbon varied within the NDVIs and followed the order: N5 (5.90, 1.93,
1.70%) N N4 (4.24, 1.56, 1.46) N N3 (3.77, 1.48, 1.42%) N N2 (3.58, 1.30,
0.93) N N1 (3.35, 1.13, 0.78%) (Table 3). The decrease of organic carbon
with the decrease in NDVI values can be owed to slower decomposition
rate in a dense canopy due to lesser solar insulation. Soil organic carbon
showed signiﬁcantly high positive correlation with NDVI, other soil nu-
trients and EC, but negative correlation with pH and bulk density. Soil
organic carbon decreased with increase in soil depth at all the NDVIs.
This argument has been supported by the reported studies [48, 50, 60,
61]. Bulk density showed a decreasing trend with increasing NDVIs
(Table 3). This can be owed to decreasing trend of organic matter with
increased decomposition rate at lower NDVI values. The reduction in
bulk density of soil with increase in soil organic carbon in the present
study have been reported by [48, 60, 62, 63]. Bulk density showed pos-
itive correlation with pH, but negative correlation with NDVI, soil or-
ganic carbon, soil nutrients and EC.
The soils of higher NDVIs were more acidic in reaction in the present
study. The pH had highly signiﬁcant negative correlation with NDVIs.
The decrease in pH at higher NDVIs is due to higher concentration of
H+ ions in the soils resulting from decomposition of organic matter.
Available N, P, K, Ca and S increased with increasing NDVIs (Table 4). In-
crease in available nitrogen content is due to higher organic carbon con-
tents of the soils of higher NDVI ranges. Increase in sulphur content can
be explained on the basis of increase in organic matter with the increase
in NDVI and are well supported by the results of Numata et al. [64]. Thus
in the present study it was found that soil nutrients were highly posi-
tively correlated with NDVI. Exchangeable Magnesium was found to de-
crease with increase in NDVI. It may be owed to the reason that the
concentrations of competing cations like K+ and Ca++ increased with
NDVI and thus the competition forced magnesium to decrease in its ex-
changeable form.
4. Conclusion
The result of the present study has revealed that soil nutrient status
improves signiﬁcantly as the altitude increases. Thus it may be con-
cluded that the higher altitudes of the Himalayan ecosystems are im-
portant reservoirs of soil organic carbon and need to be preserved
from any kind of land use change that may lead to the loss of soil organic
carbon (e.g. conversion to agricultural lands, deforestation etc.). Also, it
was found that the remote sensing tools like NDVI can be used for soil
carbon assessment and the canopy cover is a major factor in determin-
ing the soil status of the forest. Furthermore, it was also concluded from
the study that forest with mixed vegetation have a profound positive in-
ﬂuence on soil parameters as compared to pure forests, due to their re-
markable leaf litter accumulation. This may help the foresters in future
to devise planting strategies that would involve growing mixed forests
in order to comply with the REDD+ objectives.
